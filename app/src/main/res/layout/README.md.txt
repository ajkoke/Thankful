✅ Notes:  
- Save this as `README.md` in your project root (the same folder as your `app/` folder).  
- Replace `<your-github-repo-link>` with your GitHub repo URL.  
- Optional: add screenshots in the “Screenshots” section if you want to show your app visually.  

If you want, I can make a **super-short version** that’s just one page and very clean for GitHub viewers. Do you want me to do that?
